# Spam Detection in Emails

## Overview

This project implements an AI-based spam detection system for emails. The goal is to classify incoming emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. The system uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze email content and determine its category.

## Features

- **Email Classification**: Classify emails into spam or non-spam categories.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilize NLP techniques to extract features from email text, such as keywords and phrases.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and evaluate various models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and neural networks, for spam detection.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provide a simple interface for users to test the model with new email content.

## Data

The project uses publicly available datasets for training and evaluating the spam detection models. The datasets include labeled examples of spam and non-spam emails, which are used to train and test the machine learning algorithms.

   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**: Place your email datasets in the appropriate directory as specified in the configuration file.
   
2. **Train the Model**:
   Run the training script to train the spam detection model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   
3. **Test the Model**:
   Use the testing script to evaluate the model on new email content:
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```


   ```
